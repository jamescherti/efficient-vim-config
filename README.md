The **minimal-vimrc** project is a customizable Vim base that provides **better Vim defaults**, intended to serve as a solid foundation for a Vim configuration.

Creating *minimal-vimrc* involved extensive research and testing to find the best parameters and optimizations for an vimrc file. The concept behind *minimal-vimrc* is to provide a clean, bloat-free base.

By default, only essential features are enabled, providing a minimal base that is optimized. From there, users are encouraged to consult this README.md to customize and extend the configuration based your their specific needs.
